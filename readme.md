## Robot Web services
Robot Web Services is a platform that enables developers to create their own custom applications to interact with the robot controller.

Robot Web Services exposes RESTful APIs that leverages the HTTPS protocol and the messages are composed of XHTML and JSON. Robot Web Services facilitates platform independent and language independent communication with the robot controller. 

In REST, an URL identifies a resource. The representation of the application data sent from the robot controller can be either in XHTML or JSON format
